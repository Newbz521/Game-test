Marbles will generate in the middle of the board. They will then roll to a designated pocket. Your goal is to intercept these marbles with your tail prior to their touchdown. Every missed marble will deduct 5 points. Every direct hit will result in -20hp. Try to hit the marbles with your tail only!
